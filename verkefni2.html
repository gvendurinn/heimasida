									<h3 class="major">Before starting.</h3>
									<p>Starting with the program selection, we have a variety of quality 3D modeling programs to choose from. The instructor suggested Fusion 360 but I had Inventor installed and more experience with it so I'll be using that for this assignment. We start by making a custom sheet with the dimensions for the Laser cutter, it will help us determining how much material we are using. To do this we open up a new Drawing document in Inventor, choose a sheet and insert our dimensions. In our case we are working with 1000x500mm plates.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lasercutting/cuttingzone.png" alt="" /></a>
                                    <p>Next up we will be choosing what kind of model we will be making. I've always been highly interested in press fit joints, been using them when making steel brackets for a few years. It helps with fitment and also with warping while welding. I will be making a press-fit model of a house. To make a press fit joint we have to decide on some basic dimensions. We need uniformity in our joints. As soon as we figure that out we go on drawing in Inventor.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class='major'>Design criteria.</h3>
                                    <li>The house needs floors, walls and a roof.</li>
                                    <li>Walls and floors need to be press-fitted together.</li>
                                    <li>Walls need to be Parametrically adjustable, maybe we want an open space for a door?</li>
                                    <li>Find a way to make the angled roof plates hold in position, press-fit at an angle is too complex.</li>
                                    <li>Use as little matterial as possible.</li>
                                    
                                    <h3 class='major'>3D modeling</h3>
                                    <p>We will start our modeling by making a base plate. Our design will be mostly derived from the design of the base plate. I like to start with the basic dimensions of the plate and move onto the press-fit slots afterwards. The baseplate is going to be 170x170mm, the house needs to be easily manueuvered by hand. The size of the slots are varied and we need to know what material we are working with and also the accuracy of the cutting device. The laser cutter is pretty accurate and the wood we are cutting is pretty soft so our slots will be the same thickness as the material, in our case 3mm. We also need to make sure we use parameters wherever is neccesary, our baseplate will always be the same size but the size of the slots will be determined by the thickness of the material. As you can see here the slots are 5mm from the edge, the material we are using could crack if the edges are too thin.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lasercutting/base%20plate.png" style="width:728px;height:419px;"</a>
                                    <p>Now that we have chosen the size of the slots we can begin making the walls. I decided I wanted to have the option to choose how many slots the walls had and thus the wall length. It was easy enough using parameters.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lasercutting/parameters.png"</a>
                                    <p>To make custom parameters you have to open up Manage>Parameters and create a User Parameter. As shown above we have a parameter for the thickness as 3mm, height of the walls at 80mm and two number of slots for this particular wall. I used the Parameters to adjust the wall height to see what would have the best overall look and ended at 80mm. We can now insert these User Parameters into the Equation box for the Model Parameters, we can even make custom Equations! Now we can use Rectangular Pattern to duplicate with the Slot Parameter. In the case below the number of slots is three so it will end up as a three slot wall. The 50mm is the wall width but we could have used the Model Parameter (d10) in this box. </p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lasercutting/rectangular.png" style="width:868px;height:424px;"</a>
                                    <p>As I thought the roof was going to be a little bit challenging. We need four roof plates to stand on their own without the use of glue. I decided to make a semi press-fit connection to a baseplate. The roof will be inserted at an angle into the baseplate slot. I made a new part that had a plane on the base plate and used Project Geometry on the baseplate as a reference. Then I drew a basic triangle with ridges that will insert into the baseplate and also onto the counterpart plates of the roof. Here you can see dimensions used, I wanted the roof plates to intersect in the corners so I used the inside edges of the baseplate slots as reference. </p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lasercutting/roof.png"</a>
                                    
                                    <h3 class='major'>Preparing for the laser cutter.</h3>
                                    <p>We now have a complete model of our house, we now have to insert our models onto the sheet and try to optimize the placement of each part so we use the least material. We also need to go into Annotate>Edit Layers and change the "Visible" line width to 0.02mm. And voila! We have completed the drawing for the laser cutter.</p>
                                    <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lasercutting/optimizing_cutting.png" style="width:868px;height:424px;"</a>
                                        <p></p>
                                        
                                    <h3 class="major">Finished product</h3>
                                        <p>I was pretty happy with the outcome. The roof plates are pretty hard to assemble and are pretty loose but if it wont see any abuse it will hold up fine.</p>
